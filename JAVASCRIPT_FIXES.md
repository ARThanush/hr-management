# JavaScript Dependency Loading Fixes

## Issues Resolved

The following JavaScript errors have been fixed:

1. ✅ **jQuery is not defined** - Multiple scripts loading before jQuery was available
2. ✅ **$ is not defined** - Same root cause as above
3. ✅ **Pusher app key error** - Missing Pusher/Reverb configuration
4. ✅ **bootstrap-datetimepicker requires jQuery** - Loading order issue

## Changes Made

### 1. jQuery Loading Order (`resources/js/app.js`)
- Moved jQuery import to the **very first line** before any other imports
- Ensured `window.jQuery` and `window.$` are set immediately
- Fixed Select2 import (it's a jQuery plugin, not an ES module)

### 2. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
- Added `@rollup/plugin-inject` to automatically inject jQuery into all JavaScript files
- Configured to only process `.js` files (excluding CSS/SCSS)
- Added jQuery alias resolution for proper module handling

### 3. Script Loading Order (`resources/views/partials/scripts.blade.php`)
- Split `@vite()` calls to load `app.js` first
- jQuery-dependent scripts now load after jQuery is available globally

### 4. Pusher/Reverb Configuration (`resources/js/echo.js`)
- Added conditional initialization - only loads if `VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY` is set
- Shows a console warning instead of throwing error when not configured
- Real-time features will be disabled if not configured (optional)

## Environment Configuration

### If You Need Real-Time Features (Chat, Notifications)

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:

```env
# Basic Laravel Settings
APP_NAME="Laravel CIHR"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

# Database Configuration (adjust for your MAMP setup)
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel_CIHR
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root

# Pusher/Reverb Configuration for Real-Time Features
# If not using real-time features, you can leave these empty
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=null

# Pusher Configuration (if using Pusher service)
PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_APP_KEY=
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1

# Reverb Configuration (Laravel's WebSocket server)
VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
VITE_REVERB_HOST="localhost"
VITE_REVERB_PORT="8080"
VITE_REVERB_SCHEME="http"

REVERB_APP_ID=
REVERB_APP_KEY=
REVERB_APP_SECRET=
REVERB_HOST=localhost
REVERB_PORT=8080
```

### If You DON'T Need Real-Time Features

Simply set:
```env
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=null
```

The application will work perfectly without Pusher/Reverb configured.

## Next Steps

1. **Clear your browser cache** or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Rebuild assets** if you make any future changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Or for development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Generate APP_KEY** if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
4. **Run migrations** if needed:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

## Verification

After these changes, you should **NO LONGER** see these errors in the browser console:
- ❌ jQuery is not defined
- ❌ $ is not defined  
- ❌ You must pass your app key when you instantiate Pusher
- ❌ bootstrap-datetimepicker requires jQuery

## Development vs Production

- **Development**: Run `npm run dev` and keep it running. Vite will watch for changes.
- **Production**: Run `npm run build` to create optimized production assets.

**Note**: The "Slow network" warning about fonts is normal and doesn't affect functionality. It's just a browser notification about loading external resources.
